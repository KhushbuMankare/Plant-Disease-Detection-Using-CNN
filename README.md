# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-CNN
This project focuses on detecting and classifying plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a deep learning model highly effective for image recognition tasks. The goal is to help farmers and agriculturists identify plant diseases early, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop loss.
